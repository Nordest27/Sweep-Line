I recommend to use the free version of rust rover to execute this code, it handles all dependencies
automatically. You can find it here: https://play.rust-lang.org/
The program now runs the visualization with one of the 
examples, with the mouse you can change any of the segments
by clicking in one of the endpoints and dragging it to the
desired position. You can also add new segments by clicking
with the right mouse button.
